<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

'PAWS' is a noble approach to save stray dogs, cats and other pets abandoned by their owners. Through this website, we aim to prevent and eliminate all cruelty to all animals whether arising through ignorance, neglect or deliberate cruelty. We promoted the sharing of information between NGS's which are currently working to enhance the lives of animals with the animals currently in danger. What we were working on is a website what is secure, fast, reliable and easily accessible.

<!-- APPLICATIONS -->

## Applications

'PAWS' aims to connect the animals be it abandoned pets or animals suffering from human aggression with NGO's. We live in a large country where we have plenty of pets suffering and also plenty of NGO's at different parts of the country. So, PAWS wants to bring both of them together using our website. Our website is an easy-to-use platform which can be used by anyone above the age of 8 years. We hope to create a better life for all the animals out there.
