# PAWS-Animal-Rescue-And-Adoption

## About The Project

'PAWS' is a noble approach to save stray dogs, cats and other pets abandoned by their owners. Through this website, we aim to prevent and eliminate all cruelty to all animals whether arising through ignorance, neglect or deliberate cruelty. We promoted the sharing of information between NGS's which are currently working to enhance the lives of animals with the animals currently in danger. What we were working on is a website what is secure, fast, reliable and easily accessible.
